## Overview

Hi! I'm Rolando. My experience making my take on this challenge was fun, I already knew a bit about front end development but, I've started to learn React and wanted to practice, ngl I preffered this challenge insted of the ones I had where I'm learning. Anyways, I refreshed my css and html knowledge and applied the things I've learned about React; making this fully resposive page. I'm looking forward to making more complex web apps and websites and I'm excited to build them with React.
